## Profiles in Xfce4 Terminal emualator ##

Xfce4 terminal does not support profiles natively. I needed to have different
appearance (font size) on external monitor (due to different resolution).

(1) Copy the existing terminalrc

    # mkdir -p ~/.config-monitor/xfce4/terminal
    # cp ~/.config/xfce4/terminal/terminalrc ~/.config-monitor/xfce4/terminal/

(2) Create a wrapper `~/bin/xfce4-terminal` and set it as the preferred terminal
emulator in Xfce:

    #!/bin/bash

    if [[ $DISPLAY == :0.1 ]]; then
        XDG_CONFIG_HOME=~/.config-monitor /usr/bin/xfce4-terminal $@
    else
        /usr/bin/xfce4-terminal $@
    fi

(3) Add the following to `~/.bashrc` to reset the XDG_CONFIG_HOME value back in
the shell launched inside the terminal (I assume the terminal has to have "Run
command as login shell" enabled, I did not test without it).

    export XDG_CONFIG_HOME=~/.config

Yay!
