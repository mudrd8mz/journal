Protecting kernel sources
=========================

If newer kernel sources has been merged and you run --depclean before switching to the newer sources, the current sources will be
removed. But if you want to stay with the current sources, this removal is not wanted, because you may need the sources e.g. for
updating external kernel modules. It's therefore good practice to add the specific kernel version to your world file to protect it
from --depclean operations

    # emerge --ask --noreplace gentoo-sources:3.3.8

Note the slot notation, using a colon instead of a dash. Every kernel version is its own slot.


Compiling a new kernel
======================

$ eselect kernel
$ make oldconfig
$ make prepare
$ make modules_prepare
$ emerge -av @module-rebuild
$ make -j9
$ make modules_install
$ mount /boot
$ make install
$ cp /boot/vmlinuz-{the default one} /boot/efi/boot/bootx64.efi     # fallback via UEFI stub
$ cd /boot
$ make
$ vi /var/lib/portage/world         # update the version not to be cleaned

Check /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords for sys-firmware/iwl7260-ucode
version. Check

  https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/iwlwifi#d_3165_and_3168_support

to see which ucode is the latest for the 7260 wireless. It will be -17.ucode
probably. Latest can be downloaded from

  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git
