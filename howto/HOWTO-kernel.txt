Protecting kernel sources
=========================

If newer kernel sources has been merged and you run --depclean before switching to the newer sources, the current sources will be
removed. But if you want to stay with the current sources, this removal is not wanted, because you may need the sources e.g. for
updating external kernel modules. It's therefore good practice to add the specific kernel version to your world file to protect it
from --depclean operations

    # emerge --ask --noreplace gentoo-sources:3.3.8

Note the slot notation, using a colon instead of a dash. Every kernel version is its own slot.


Compiling a new kernel
======================

$ eselect kernel
$ make oldconfig
$ make prepare
$ make modules_prepare
$ emerge -av @module-rebuild
$ make -j5
$ make modules_install
$ mount /boot
$ make install
$ cp /boot/vmlinuz-{the default one} /boot/efi/boot/bootx64.efi     # fallback via UEFI stub
$ cd /boot
$ make

Check /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords for sys-firmware/iwl7260-ucode version.
